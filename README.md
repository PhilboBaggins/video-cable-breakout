A small breakout board for various video connectors (DisplayPort, HDMI and VGA so far).

Photo of assembled board sitting on a my [Generic Board Box](https://github.com/PhilboBaggins/generic-board-box). This video cable breakout board does not have any of the 0.1" headers soldered because I was just using the board for an easy place to probe signals with an oscilloscope.
